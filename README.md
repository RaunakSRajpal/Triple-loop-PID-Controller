# Triple-loop-PID-Controller
This project is a real-life implementation of the research paper [Motor control application based on STM32 and PID control theory by Zhao Zhetuo, HKUST](https://github.com/RaunakSRajpal/Triple-loop-PID-Controller/blob/main/PID-STM.pdf) on an Arduino UNO.

The objective of the project is to precisely control the rotation angle and rotational speed of a DC brush motor, which is provided by a potentiometer. The developed board should be able to toggle between speed controller configuration and angle controller configuration.

## Control Algorithm
The control law is based on 3 cascaded PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control loops, regulating individually over the **driver current**, **angular speed (rpm)** of the motor, and the **rotation angle** of the motor.

The innermost PID loop controlling the motor current, and the outermost loop controlling the theta.

### TVP
Trapezoidal velocity profile (TVP) generation has been used for getting the __*setpoint angular speed*__ (rpm). The TVP is generated by the following equations[^2]:

>$$ t_{acc,∆} = \sqrt{θ_{max}/a} $$
>
>$$ t_{acc,traz} = ω_{max}/a $$
>
>$$ T = t_{const} + t_{acc,traz} $$

where, __a__ is the _maximum constant acceleration_,
