# Triple-loop-PID-Controller
This project is a real-life implementation of the research paper [Motor control application based on STM32 and PID control theory by Zhao Zhetuo, HKUST](../) on an Arduino UNO.

The objective of the project is to precisely control the rotation angle and rotational speed of a DC brush motor, which is provided by a potentiometer. The developed board should be able to toggle between speed controller configuration and angle controller configuration.
